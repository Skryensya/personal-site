## Context

This personal portfolio represents the culmination of my frontend web development experience, combining modern technologies with a brutally minimalist design that prioritizes functionality over decoration.

The project philosophy is based on three fundamental pillars: **total accessibility**, **optimal performance**, and **frictionless user experience**.

## Technologies and Architecture

The site is built with **Astro.js 5.12.3** as the main framework, leveraging static site generation for ultra-fast loading times. React is used only for specific interactive components, following the "hydration islands" pattern that minimizes client-side JavaScript.

**Tailwind CSS** provides the design system with a strictly limited two-color palette that inverts between light and dark modes, always maintaining maximum contrast for accessibility.

## Internationalization System

I implemented a fully functional i18n system supporting three languages:

- Spanish (default language, no URL prefix)
- English (`/en/` prefix)
- Norwegian (`/no/` prefix)

The system includes automatic language detection, localized routes, and a centralized translation dictionary that ensures consistency across the entire application.

## Performance and Optimization

The site achieves perfect Lighthouse scores thanks to:

- Static generation that eliminates server time
- Automatic image optimization with WebP formats
- Lazy loading of non-critical React components
- Inlined critical CSS for above-the-fold content
- JavaScript bundle under 150kb gzipped

## Accessibility and Usability

Every component was designed from scratch considering WCAG guidelines:

- Full keyboard navigation
- Total screen reader support
- Contrast ratios exceeding AAA standards
- Descriptive alt texts on all images
- Visible focus and correct HTML semantics
