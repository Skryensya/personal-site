# Toda la Teoría del Universo (TTU)

**Toda la Teoría del Universo (TTU)** is an independent cultural center based in Concepción. Since 2015, it has fostered intersections between arts, technology, sciences, and community knowledge. With a transdisciplinary approach, TTU organizes residencies, festivals, training programs, and editorial projects, connecting Biobío with other regions of Chile and Latin America.  

## Project requirements

The website needed to reflect this flexible and experimental identity, while also meeting practical requirements:  

- **Dynamic page creation** within the content tree.  
- **Modular block-based editing**, so the team could easily update activities, programs, and publications.  
- **Targeted interactivity** in specific sections through custom components.  

## Contribution

My role was focused on the **technical implementation of the site**, not the visual design. I was responsible for:  

- Configuring and developing the CMS in **ProcessWire**, adapting its structure to a page-and-block model that TTU’s team could manage independently.  
- Building **React components** used as interactive widgets in key sections of the site.  
- Front-end layout with **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring visual consistency and agile development.  
- Integrating CMS and front-end so content could be fully manageable without sacrificing interactivity.  
- Performance optimization and deployment to guarantee smooth access across devices.  

## Technologies used

- **ProcessWire (PHP)** as a flexible, modular CMS.  
- **React** for interactive components (widgets).  
- **Tailwind CSS** for layout and styling.  

## Result

The TTU website enables the institution to maintain a **living digital presence**, consistent with its collective and experimental approach. The team can create new sections, update block-based content, and retain full autonomy over the portal’s management—while offering visitors a clear experience enhanced by interactive elements in key areas.
