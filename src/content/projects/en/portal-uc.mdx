# UC Portal

The **UC Portal** is the main website of Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. It brings together news, academic information, and access to essential services for **over 33,000 students, 3,500 faculty members, and thousands of administrative staff**.

Its design and functionality rely directly on the **UC Digital Kit**, ensuring visual and technical consistency across the broader institutional web ecosystem.

## My contribution

- **New sections and redesigns**  
  I contributed to the creation of strategic sections of the portal (such as admissions, news, and student resources), ensuring that information was well-organized and easy to navigate. I also developed targeted redesigns of critical areas, always tailored to the evolving needs of the university community.

- **Maintenance and stability**  
  UC Portal is a high-demand, constantly evolving website. I worked on general maintenance, fixing issues, and ensuring continuous operation without disrupting access to key services.

- **Accessibility as a priority**  
  I optimized keyboard navigation and ensured compatibility with screen readers. These improvements not only align with **WCAG standards**, but also expand inclusive access to the platform for the entire community.

- **Integration with the UC Digital Kit**  
  Every improvement made to the Portal was coordinated with the UC Digital Kit team, so that changes could be replicated and benefit the entire network of institutional websites.

## Technologies used

- **UC Digital Kit** as the component foundation.
- **PHP and institutional CMS** (legacy infrastructure).
- **CSS/SCSS and Vanilla JS** for styling and behavior adjustments.

## Impact

UC Portal is the university’s **digital gateway**. Every improvement in performance, accessibility, or usability has a direct impact on the experience of thousands of daily users. Furthermore, optimizations implemented here extend to other sites that share the same technological base via the UC Digital Kit, amplifying their reach across the entire ecosystem.
