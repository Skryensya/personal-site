# Hostal Micelio

**Hostal Micelio** is a landing page created as a sales funnel for a hostel located in Villarrica. The goal was to develop a simple yet effective site that guides users directly to booking through a WhatsApp channel.

## Project objective

The main focus was to build a clear and straightforward experience: presenting essential information about the hostel, building trust, and making the booking action as seamless as possible. The page acts as a digital showcase that is simple but efficient, tailored to the client’s specific needs.

## Contribution

In this project I worked end-to-end, from visual concept to implementation in code. My contributions included:

- Custom visual design, taking full creative control to reflect the hostel’s identity.
- Simple navigation structure, designed as a funnel leading users toward booking.
- Clean and organized sections: hostel overview, rooms, services, location, and a clear call-to-action.
- Performance optimization to ensure a fast and smooth experience across devices.

## Technologies used

- **React + Next.js** as the development framework.
- **Tailwind CSS** for layout and visual styling.

## Functionality

The landing page follows a clear flow:

1. Eye-catching hero with a booking call-to-action.
2. Informational sections detailing the hostel’s services and features.
3. Location and contact information.
4. Persistent call-to-action leading users to complete the booking via WhatsApp.

## Lessons and learnings

This project allowed me to:

- Explore a fully freeform design, making creative decisions aligned with the client’s identity.
- Apply minimalist UX principles, showing only what was necessary to guide the user.
- Deepen my experience using Next.js and Tailwind CSS in building conversion-focused landing pages.
