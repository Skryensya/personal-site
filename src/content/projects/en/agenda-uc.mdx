# Agenda UC

**Agenda UC** is the centralized system for publishing and exploring academic, cultural, and administrative activities at the university. Its goal is to make it simple and accessible for students, faculty, and staff to find and organize relevant events.

The platform is built with a **Strapi backend** and a **React/Next.js frontend**, using components from the **UC Digital Kit** to maintain institutional consistency across the wider digital ecosystem.

## My contribution

- **Data model design (Strapi API)**  
  I participated in defining and structuring the data model, including support for events with multiple dates, recurrences, and relationships between activities. This resulted in a flexible API capable of handling anything from a simple one-off event to conferences with multiple sessions and complex schedules.

- **Performance optimization**  
  I optimized queries and relationships to ensure information was coherent and loaded quickly, even with large volumes of data or when users applied filters.

- **Frontend development (React/Next.js)**  
  I implemented the complete Agenda interface using the **UC Digital Kit** as the component foundation. When necessary, I created custom components that strictly followed the institutional design guidelines, ensuring a seamless and consistent experience.

- **Accessibility as a standard**  
  I applied **WCAG 2.1 AA** guidelines, making sure that filters, event lists, and navigation could be used with keyboards and screen readers. Accessibility was built into the platform from the very beginning.

## Technologies used

- **Strapi (Node.js)** for the event API.
- **React + Next.js** for the dynamic frontend.
- **UC Digital Kit** as the component foundation.
- **CSS/SCSS** for visual customization.

## Impact

Agenda UC has transformed the way the university community discovers and organizes academic and cultural life. Its flexible architecture and accessible frontend ensure that thousands of students and faculty can engage with the platform inclusively and in full alignment with the rest of UC’s digital ecosystem.
