# Accessibility, SEO, and Performance Optimization Across 100+ Institutional Websites

## Context

Kit Digital UC is a centralized component library aimed at unifying the visual and functional experience across the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile’s web ecosystem. The library currently supports over 100 websites, ranging from academic portals to internal tools.  
The main challenge has been maintaining backward compatibility due to distribution via AWS S3 and CDN, while continuously introducing improvements in accessibility, performance, and scalability. Striking this balance is critical to avoid disrupting active services and ensure sustainable evolution.

## My Contribution

Since joining the project in late 2022, I conducted a comprehensive audit of existing components to identify critical accessibility and semantic gaps. I then led the implementation of targeted solutions, including:

- Migrating background images (`background-image`) to `<img>` elements, allowing the inclusion of meaningful `alt` attributes that improve assistive technology support and SEO.
- Implementing dynamic imports to load only necessary components per page, reducing overall bundle size and improving initial load times.
- Refactoring keyboard navigation in menus, accordions, and modals to comply with WCAG standards and enhance accessibility for users with reduced mobility.

Additionally, I collaborated closely with design and development teams to align new components with institutional style guides and ensure smooth integration into cross-functional projects like Portal UC and Agenda UC.

## Challenges Faced

Maintaining backward compatibility was one of the most significant challenges, as any change required careful evaluation to prevent breaking functionality on sites relying on older Kit versions. We designed progressive deployment strategies and leveraged dynamic imports as a key solution.  
Addressing poor accessibility practices involved not only technical fixes but also raising awareness and documenting standards to foster a more inclusive development culture.  
Working across multiple frameworks and technologies (Vue/Nuxt for existing documentation, React/Next for the new platform) required coordinating migrations without interrupting project continuity.

## Results and Learnings

The implemented improvements delivered a smoother, more accessible user experience, validated through internal testing and performance metrics. Conditional component loading significantly reduced bundle size, positively impacting Core Web Vitals and SEO.  
This project reinforced the importance of treating accessibility as an ongoing process integrated throughout design, development, and maintenance. It also highlighted the need for careful planning when evolving technology in distributed ecosystems, prioritizing stability and compatibility.

## Technology Stack

- **Languages and styles:** JavaScript, CSS (SASS/SCSS)
- **Build tools:** Rollup, NPM
- **Frameworks:** Vue (Nuxt.js) for existing documentation, migrating to React (Next.js) with Strapi CMS
- **Distribution infrastructure:** AWS S3 and CDN to deliver Kit Digital UC packages
