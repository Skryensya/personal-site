### **TL;DR**

The **UC Digital Kit** is a **component library** that ensures **consistent visual identity** and better **usability** across **Universidad Católica** websites. Distributed via **CDN**, it's used on over **100 sites**. Since **2022**, I've worked on **creating and improving components**, focusing on following **accessibility best practices**. The main challenge has been maintaining **backward compatibility** while updating and optimizing key components.

## **Description**

It consists of a **reusable component library**, created to maintain **uniform visual identity** and **optimized user experience** across all **Universidad Católica** sites. It covers everything from basic elements like **cards**, **buttons** and **forms**, to more advanced components like the **global topbar** and **agenda widget**, facilitating the development of consistent interfaces across multiple sites.

The Kit is mainly distributed via **CDN**, enabling its adoption on over **100 sites**, with the goal that all future developments implement it. To support developers, there's also a **documentation site**, originally developed with **Vue (Nuxt.js)** and currently being migrated to **React (Next.js)** with a **Strapi CMS**. This transition will speed up updates and improve information management.

## **My Contribution**

Since **2022**, I've been part of the team responsible for **creating, improving, and maintaining** the components in the Digital Kit. My work has focused on:

- **Component development**: Creating new reusable components following design guidelines and accessibility best practices.
- **Optimization and updates**: Improving existing components for better performance and usability.
- **Documentation**: Collaborating on the documentation site to ensure developers have clear and updated resources.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Ensuring components work correctly across different browsers and devices.

The biggest challenge has been maintaining **backward compatibility** while implementing improvements, ensuring that updates don't break existing implementations across the 100+ sites using the library.
