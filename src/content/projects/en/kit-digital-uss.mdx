## Kit Digital USS (In Development)

Ambitious project comprising the development of two complementary and more robust component libraries for Universidad San Sebasti√°n: a Vanilla JavaScript library and a React library. This project represents the natural evolution of previous design systems, incorporating lessons learned and current best practices.

### Key Features

- **Dual implementation** (Vanilla JS and React) for maximum flexibility
- **Advanced accessibility** with complete ARIA support
- **Comprehensive technical documentation** with interactive examples
- **Advanced theming system** for institutional customization
- **Automated testing** to ensure quality and stability

### Technologies Used

- **JavaScript ES2023** with modern and optimized syntax
- **Semantic HTML** with accessible structure by default
- **CSS with SASS** using BEM methodology and CSS Custom Properties
- **Rollup** as bundler with optimized tree-shaking
- **React 18+** with hooks and concurrent features
- **TypeScript** for type safety in the React version

### Project Innovations

- **Modular architecture** allowing individual component imports
- **Centralized design token system** and reusable
- **Integrated development tools** for better DX
- **Interactive playground** for real-time component testing
- **Custom CLI** for scaffolding and maintenance

### Current Status

The project is in active development phase, with:
- ‚úÖ Base architecture defined and implemented
- ‚úÖ First core components developed
- ‚úÖ Build and distribution system configured
- üîÑ Complex component development in progress
- üîÑ Technical documentation and usage guides
- ‚è≥ E2E testing and QA tools

### My Role

As principal developer of both libraries, I handle architecture design, component implementation, build system configuration, and creation of all technical documentation. My goal is to deliver a product that establishes a new quality standard in web component development for educational institutions.

### Project Vision

This digital kit will not only serve Universidad San Sebasti√°n, but is being designed as a reusable framework that can be adapted to other educational institutions, establishing new standards in accessibility, performance, and developer experience.
