## Project Context

Development of a complete analytics platform that allows companies to visualize and analyze large volumes of data in real-time, with capacity to process millions of daily events.

The system provides actionable insights through interactive visualizations and automatic alerts based on customizable thresholds.

## System Architecture

**Frontend**: React with TypeScript, implementing a modular component architecture that allows creating custom dashboards through drag & drop.

**Visualizations**: D3.js for complex and custom charts, Chart.js for standard visualizations, interactive maps with Leaflet.

**Backend**: Node.js with microservices architecture, data stream processing with Apache Kafka, and ClickHouse storage for ultra-fast analytical queries.

## Key Functionalities

### Real-time Processing
Data ingestion system that processes events in real-time using WebSockets for instant dashboard updates without page reloads.

### Interactive Visualizations
- Line and bar charts with zoom and pan
- Geographic heatmaps for location analysis
- Conversion funnels with drill-down capabilities
- Virtualized tables to handle large datasets

### Alert System
Custom alert configuration with dynamic thresholds, email/Slack notifications, and automatic escalation based on criticality.

### Customizable Dashboards
Visual editor that allows users to create custom dashboards by dragging widgets, configuring metrics, and defining time periods.

## Performance Optimizations

- List virtualization to handle thousands of rows
- Query debouncing to reduce server load
- Smart caching with automatic invalidation
- Lazy loading of visualization components
- SQL query optimization with specialized indexes

## Scalability and Monitoring

The system is designed to scale horizontally:
- Load balancing with NGINX
- Node.js clustering to leverage multiple cores
- Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
- Centralized logging with ELK Stack
- Automatic health checks and failure recovery
