## Overview

Development of a robust and scalable e-commerce platform that handles the complete online sales cycle, from product presentation to payment processing and inventory management.

The system processes over 1000 daily transactions and is designed to scale horizontally according to business demand.

## Technology Stack

**Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, implementing responsive design with Tailwind CSS and global state management with Zustand.

**Backend**: Node.js with Express, microservices architecture that separates business logic into independent modules (authentication, products, payments, inventory).

**Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM, optimized for complex queries and entity relationships.

## Key Features

### Authentication System
JWT implementation with refresh tokens, optional two-factor authentication, and OAuth provider integration (Google, Facebook).

### Product Management
Complete CRUD with multiple image uploads, advanced categorization, variant system (size, color), and real-time stock management.

### Cart and Checkout
Persistent cart between sessions, dynamic shipping calculation based on location, integration with multiple payment methods (Stripe, PayPal), and automatic invoice generation.

### Admin Panel
Complete dashboard with sales metrics, product management, order tracking, and analytical reports with interactive visualizations.

## Performance Optimizations

- Redis cache implementation for frequent queries
- Image optimization with lazy loading and multiple formats
- Code splitting at route and component level
- Gzip compression and asset minification
- CDN for static content distribution

## Security

- Data validation and sanitization on frontend and backend
- Protection against CSRF and XSS attacks
- Rate limiting for critical APIs
- Sensitive data encryption
- Periodic security audits
