# Barrancas

**Barrancas** is a comprehensive survey platform designed for educational institutions, aimed at **detecting and supporting students at risk of academic, social, or emotional difficulties at an early stage**. The tool combines technology and pedagogy to strengthen student well-being and support better decision-making by administrators and educators.

## Key features

- **Customizable surveys** tailored to different educational levels.
- **Early alert system** that identifies students at risk.
- **Analytical dashboard** for educators and administrators with clear metrics.
- **Automated reports** with actionable insights.

## Technologies used

- **Vue.js** for a reactive and accessible user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive and consistent design.
- **AdonisJS** as a robust and scalable backend framework.
- **MySQL** for secure storage of sensitive data.

## Core functionalities

- Multi-format surveys (multiple choice, scales, free text).
- Risk detection algorithms to identify patterns of concern.
- Interactive dashboard for educators with visualizations.
- Notification system and individual case tracking.
- Data export for external analysis.

## Social impact

Barrancas has enabled schools to:

- Proactively identify students in need of support.
- Implement early and personalized interventions.
- Improve retention and academic success rates.
- Foster more inclusive and safer school environments.

## My role

I was responsible for the **end-to-end full-stack development** of the platform, from backend architecture to the implementation of the user interface. I also led the platformâ€™s continuous evolution, adding new functionalities based on educator feedback.

## Ongoing development

The project continues to evolve with improvements such as:

- Integrations with existing academic systems.
- Direct communication tools for educators, students, and families.
